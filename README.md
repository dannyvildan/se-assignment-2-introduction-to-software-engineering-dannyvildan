Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
a) Waterfall Model:
Approach: Sequential; each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.
Phases: Typically include requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance, done in a linear order.
Flexibility: Low; changes are difficult and costly to implement once a phase is completed.
Documentation: Extensive; each phase has comprehensive documentation before moving to the next phase.
Scenarios Preferred: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and low risk of changes, such as construction projects or projects with clear, unchanging objectives​​.

b) Agile Model:
Approach: Iterative and incremental; development is done in small, iterative cycles called sprints.
Phases: Requirements, design, implementation, and testing occur in each sprint, allowing for continuous feedback and improvement.
Flexibility: High; changes can be easily accommodated in subsequent iterations.
Documentation: Minimal; focuses more on working software and customer collaboration rather than extensive documentation.
Scenarios Preferred: Ideal for projects with evolving requirements, high uncertainty, or a need for frequent user feedback, such as software development for startups or dynamic projects where user needs may change frequently​​.

Key Differences:
1) Flexibility:
Waterfall: Less flexible due to its sequential nature.
Agile: Highly flexible, allowing changes even late in the development process.

2) Risk Management:
Waterfall: Higher risk as issues may only be discovered in later phases.
Agile: Lower risk due to continuous testing and feedback throughout the development process.

3) Customer Involvement:
Waterfall: Limited to the initial and final phases.
Agile: Continuous involvement and feedback from the customer throughout the development process.

4) Delivery:
Waterfall: Single delivery at the end of the project.
Agile: Incremental deliveries of functional software throughout the project lifecycle.
